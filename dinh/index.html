    I am currently in my third year as a graphic design major here at MSU. I live in Mankato with my parents and two younger sisters, and we’ve lived in this same city our whole lives which is still pretty crazy to me. After I graduate, I hope to move to Minneapolis and possibly somewhere out of state eventually--wherever my career might take me.

I was introduced to graphic design when I was really young, probably around 8 or 9. I spent a lot of time sitting behind a computer playing games and I was inspired bythe art that I was seeing for these games. I was pretty computer savvy for a kid my age, and that led to my experimenting with a bunch of strange bootleg photoshop programs. It wasn’t until later in my highschool years that I discovered graphic design was a real career that people pursued and that it was more than just photoshop.

Outside of school and graphic design, I love spending time on my other hobbies such as: 

    <ul>
        <li><b>Drawing</b> - Lately, I've been experimenting with digital drawing.</li>
        <li><b>Painting</b> I love acrylics, watercolor, and pastels.</li>
        <li><b>Music</b> - I love listening to music, play violin, and I also sing.</li>
        <li><b>Cooking and baking</b> - I love learning how to make all sorts of food, but lately I've been into cooking asian dishes and baking cakes.</li>
        <li><b>Sewing new clothing pieces</b> </li>
        <li><b>Embroidery</b> - I've made some embroidery patches for myself and to use on sweaters as gifts for friends.</li>
        <li><b>Playing games</b> - I finally upgraded from playing on a laptop and built my first computer during quarantine to play with my friends.  </li>
    </ul>

I count myself very fortunate for the fact that my education and outside hobbies both serve as inspiration for the other. Although I spend a lot of time being creative, I don’t usually feel burnt out because of how different each of my projects are. From music to embroidery, cooking, painting, or sewing, I always like finding something new to keep myself busy and inspired.
